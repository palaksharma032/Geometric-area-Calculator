## Geometry Area Calculator
A lightweight Python Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that calculates the area of common geometric shapes. This was created as a mini-project to practice basic Python logic, user input handling, and the math module. 

## Features
- Square: Calculates area using the length of one side.
- Rectangle: Calculates area based on length and width.
- Triangle: Uses the base and height formula.
Circle: Utilizes Python's math.pi for high-precision circle area calculation.

## Requirements
Python 3. No external libraries required (uses the built-in math module).

## How to Run Clone the repository: 
- Bashgit clone https://github.com/palaksharma032/Geometric-area-Calculator.git
- Navigate to the project folder: Bashcd geometry-area-calculator
- Run the script: Bashpython area_calculator.py

## Example Usage:
Select a shape to calculate area:
1. Square
2. Rectangle
3. Triangle
4. Circle

Enter option (1-4): 4
Enter Radius: 5
Area of circle is 78.53981633974483

## What I Learned:
- Converting input() strings to float() for mathematical operations.
- Implementing if-elif-else conditional branching.
- Working with the Python math library for constants like "pi".
- Basic error handling for invalid user selections.
